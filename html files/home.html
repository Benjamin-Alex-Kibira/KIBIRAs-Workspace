			<h2>UFarm Program Overview</h2>
			<p>The Masajja Division Urban Farming Initiative, named Ufarm, aims to promote and support urban farming practices and improve family earnings and livelihoods by easing market access. The initiative is divided into 4 urban wards, with each ward having an appointed FarmerOne (FO) who acts as the contact person for the Agricultural Officer (AO). The program only includes fresh horticulture produce, poultry, and dairy products.</p>
			<p>Our goal is to create a sustainable urban agriculture system that benefits both farmers and consumers. With Ufarm, farmers can earn a fair income by selling their produce directly to consumers, while consumers can enjoy fresh, healthy, locally-grown food at affordable prices.</p>

			<h2>How to Get Started</h2>
			<p>If you are interested in becoming a farmer with UFarm, you can get started by registering with a FarmerOne in your ward. They will provide you with all the information and support you need to start growing and selling your produce through the Ufarm program.</p>
			<p>Alternatively, if you are a consumer looking to purchase fresh produce through UFarm, you can browse the listings on our Consumer Dashboard and place an order through our mailing or dial-in system.</p>
